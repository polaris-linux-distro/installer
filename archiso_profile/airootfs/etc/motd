To install Polaris Linux:

To connect to Wi-Fi, authenticate to the wireless network using the [35miwctl[0m utility. (ArchWiki page)
For mobile broadband (WWAN) modems, connect with the [35mmmcli[0m utility. (ArchWiki page)
Ethernet, WLAN and WWAN interfaces using DHCP should work automatically.

From there, you can navigate the text based installer in [35minstall-polaris[0m

If you want to recover data, you should check out
[35mtestdisk[0m and [35mphotorec[0m

For partitioning, check out
[35mcfdisk[0m, [35mfdisk[0m and [35mparted[0m

All of these commands are currently on the system.
Happy hacking!
